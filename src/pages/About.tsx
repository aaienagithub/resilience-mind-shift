              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Aaiena was born from a simple observation: despite tremendous advances in neuroscience, there remained a significant gap between laboratory research and practical tools for building emotional resilience in everyday life.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Our team of neuroscientists, psychologists, and wellness experts set out to create a methodology that translates cutting-edge brain science into accessible techniques that create measurable improvements in emotional well-being.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
                Today, Aaiena's programs serve therapists, organizations, and individuals worldwide, providing science-backed tools that create lasting change in how people respond to life's challenges.
